\section*{Abstract}

The knot group $G=\pi_1(K)$ is a starting point for many knot invariants. Alexander matrix is a representation matrix for a subgroup of $G$ and from its determinant, the Alexander polynomial is obtained. Another way of obtaining said polynomial is by considering a coloring matrix which assigns elements of $R$-module $M$ to segments from a diagram $D$ of knot $K$. This approach can be derived from the image of a resolution of Alexander module through the functor $\Hom(-, M)$. Nevertheless, color checking matrices do not instantly yield a knot invariant, however it is possible to define an equivalence relation that identifies matrices stemming from the same knot. This approach is used to distinguish a pair of knots with the same Alexander polynomial. In the end, a way of generalizing the procedure of coloring diagrams is presented in terms of category theory.

\section*{Introduction}

\Cref{sec1} defines the fundamental ideas of this paper, such as the knot group (see \cref{knot gorup def}) its metabelianization (see \cref{def:metabelianization}) and the Alexander module (see \cref{alexander module def}). Two equivalent definitions fot said modules are presented: an algebraic one and a topological one. In a purely algebraical sense, the Alexander moule is the abelianized subgroup $[[G, G], [G, G]]$ of the knot group $G$, with $\Z$ action induced by abelianization homomorphism $G\to \Z$, while from a topological point of view it is the first homology module of the infinite cyclic cover (see \cref{inf cyclic cover}). An important result finishing this section is that the Alexander module is a torsion module (see \cref{prop: modul alexandera jest torsyjny}).

\Cref{section2} is dedicated to the Alexander matrix (see \cref{alexander matrix def}) its properties and ivariant nature of its determinant.
