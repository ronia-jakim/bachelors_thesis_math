We can think of coloring diagrams with a chosen palette $(R, M, \mathcal{C}_\pm)$ as being a {\color{red}functor from a set of diagrams to a set of matrices}.

\begin{definition}[color checking matrix]\label{def:color checking matrix}
  Assigning segments of diagram $D$ to coordinates in $M^s$ and crossings to coordinates in $N_\pm^x$ it is possible to define a linear homomorphism $D\phi:M^s\to N_\pm^x$  as
  $$D\phi(m_1,...,m_s)=(\phi_\pm(\pi_{x_1}(m_1,...,m_s)), \phi_\pm(\pi_{x_2}(m_1,...,m_s)),...).$$
  Matrix that is created after choosing a basis for $M^s$ and $N_\pm^x$ will be called a \buff{color checking matrix}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Coloring $(m_1,...,m_s)\in M^s$ is admissible $\iff$ $(m_1,...,m_s)\in\ker D\phi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We start by saying that 
  $$(m_1,..., m_s)\in\ker D\phi\iff [(\forall\;x_j\text{ crossing})\;\phi_\pm(\pi_{x_j}(m_1,..., m_s))=0].$$
  Which is to say that every coordinate of $D\phi(m_1,..., m_s)$ is zero. Proposition \cref{proposition male kernel kolorowania} says that it is equivalent with $(m_1,..., m_s)$ being an admissible coloring.
\end{proof}

We want to define which color checking matrices are isomorphic. We will say that $D\phi$ and $D'\phi$ are isomorphic if 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item they differ by a permutation of rows or columns, 
  \item one can be obtained from the other by adding a linear combination of rows or columns to another row or columns 
  \item one can be obtained from the other by adding a new row and a new column with only $0$ save for the term on their intersection, which is a unit.
\end{enumerate}
The first two points mean that two color checking matrices $D\phi, D'\phi:M^s\to N^x$ are isomorphic if there exist isomorphisms $\theta:M^s\to M^s$ and $\psi:N^x\to N^x$ such that
$$
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
  M^s\arrow[r, "D\phi"]\arrow[d, "\theta" left] & N^x\arrow[d, "\psi" right]\\ 
  M^s\arrow[r, "D'\phi" below] & N^x
\end{tikzcd}
$$
is a commutative diagram. 

In the most basic sense, two diagrams $D$ and $D'$ are isomorphic (equivalent) if there exists an isotopy $h:\R^2\to R^2$ such that $h(D)=D'$ and $D'$ has crossings identical to those of $D$.

\begin{lemma}
  Isomorphic diagrams $D\sim D'$ yield isomorphic color checking matrices $D\phi\sim D'\phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  In terms of color checking matrices, an isomorphism of diagrams defined above only relabels segments (permutes columns) and crossings (permutes rows).
\end{proof}

In reality, the isomorphism between diagrams which relates diagrams of the same knot is much more subtle. This relation $R$ is generated by the Reidemeister moves (see \cref{reidemeister-generating}). There is an induced relation on the set of color checking matrices, called $m(R)$, that relates color checking matrices of the same knot. For suitably chosen palettes, an invariant of the equivalent class of matrices of the same knot is easily obtainable. One of such palettes is \buff{Alexander palette} {\boldmath$(R=\Z[\Z], M=\Z[\Z], \mathcal{C}_\pm)$}, where $\mathcal{C}_\pm$ is defined by homomorphisms
$$\phi_+(u,i,o)=(1-t)u+ti-o$$
$$\phi_-(u,i,o)=(1-t^{-1})u+t^{-1}i-o,$$
with $u$, $i$ and $o$ defined in \cref{crossing_type}. For the Alexander palette said invariant is e.g. the determinant of a color checking matrix up to multiplication by a unit. 

Consider the following example illustrating the importance of choosing a suitable palette:

\begin{example}
  Consider a coloring of trefoil knot $3_1$ with palette $(\Z, \Z, \phi_\pm(u,i,o)=2u-i+o)$. The color checking matrix of its diagram with $3$ crossings is
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{knot}[
        consider self intersections, 
        clip width = 20pt, 
        % draft mode=crossings, 
        flip crossing=2
        ] 
        \strand[->, thick] (90:2) to[out=0, in=-60, looseness=2]
        (210:2) to[out=120, in=60, looseness=2]
        (-30:2) to[out=-120, in=180, looseness=2] 
        (90:2);
      \end{knot}

      \node at (6, 0) {
        $\det
        \begin{bmatrix}
          2 & -1 & 1\\ 
          -1 & 1 & 2 \\ 
          1 & 2 & -1 
        \end{bmatrix}=-3
      $};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  while after the first Reiidemeister move, the color checking matrix is

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{knot}[
        consider self intersections, 
        clip width = 20pt,
        %ignore endpoint intersections=false,
        % draft mode=crossings,
        % flip crossin=1,
        % flip crossing=2
        ] 
        \strand[<-, thick] (80:3) to[out=-100, in=30] 
        (90:2) to[out=-30, in=-60, looseness=2]
        (210:2) to[out=120, in=60, looseness=2]
        (-30:2) to[out=-120, in=210, looseness=2] 
        (90:2) to[out=150, in=-80] 
        (100:3) to[out=100, in=80, looseness=2] 
        (80:3);
      \end{knot}
      \fill[white] (90:2) circle (10pt);
      \draw[thick] ($(90:2)+({0.3*cos(210)}, {0.3*sin(210)})+(-0.02, -0.07)$) to[out=30, in=-120] ($(90:2) + ({0.3*cos(30}, {0.3*sin(30})+(0, 0.08)$);%(80:3);
      % \draw[->, thin] (90:2) to[out=-30, in=-60, loosenes=2] (210:2);
      \node at (6, 0) {$\det
          \begin{bmatrix}
            0 & 2 & 1 & -1 \\ 
            0 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\ 
            1 & 0 & -1 & 2\\ 
            1 & 1 & 0 & 0
          \end{bmatrix}=-8$
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
\end{example}

{\color{red}from now on we want to work with palettes that satisfy the following conditions: dwuwymiaroowe C i propagation rule, to a = 1-b, b beta = 1 oraz a beta + alpha = 0. in particular, we want to work with the Alexander palette and all palettes derived from it}
