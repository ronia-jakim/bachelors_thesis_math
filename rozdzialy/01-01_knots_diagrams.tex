In mathematical terms, a knot is a smooth embedding $S^1\hookrightarrow S^3$. A knot diagram is an {immersive projection} $D:S^1\hookrightarrow \R^2$ along a vector such that no three points of the knot lay on this vector \cite{likorish-diagram}. If two points are mapped to one by this projection, we say that a small neighbourhood of this point which looks locally like \begin{tikzpicture}\draw(-.5ex,0)--(2.5ex, 0ex); \fill[white](1ex, 0) circle (.5ex);\draw(1ex, -1ex)--(1ex, 1ex);\end{tikzpicture} is a crossing.

% $S^1$ is an orientable space thus we can choose an orientation for a knot being considered. Then a diagram $D$ is oriented if it is a projection of an oriented $S^1$.

$S^1$ is orientable, thus we can chose an orientation for any knot and, as a consequence, its diagram.

Intuitively, two knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ are equivalent if we can deform one into the other
%without cutting it and only manipulating it with our hands 
\cite{murasagi-equivalence}. This translates to an equivalence of diagrams, which is generated by comparing diagrams that are exactly the same save for an interior of some disc in $R^2$. If inside of said disc the diagrams differ by one of \buff{Reidemeister moves}, we say that they are equivalent. 
%
% This translates to equivalence of diagrams, which is generated by a set of moves, called the \buff{Reidemeister moves}. 
%
In the case of a diagram without an orientation, three moves are sufficient. When an orientation is imposed on $D$, $4$ diagram moves (pictured in \cref{reidemeister-generating}) generate the whole equivalence relation \cite{ruchy_zorientowane}.
