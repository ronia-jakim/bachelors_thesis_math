\section{Knot coloring}

Let $R$ be any commutative ring with unity and let $M$, $N$ be two $R$-modules with a module homomorphism $\omega:M^3\to N$.

Now, consider a link diagram $D$ with $s$ arcs and $x$ crossings. To each arc assign a number from $1$ to $s$ and to each crossing - from $1$ to $x$.
\medskip

\begin{definition}[color checking matrix]\label{color checking matrix 01}
  Consider modules $M^s$ and $N^x$. Assign a generator of the $i$-th component of $M^s$ to the arc labeled with $i$ and a generator of the $j$-th component of $N^x$ to the crossing labeled $j$. 

  Let $(0,...,0,a_i,0...,0)$, $a_i\in M$ for $i=1,2,3$ be elements taken from components of $M^s$ corresponding to arcs creating a crossing labeled $c$. Let $p_c:N^x\twoheadrightarrow N$ be a projection onto component assigned to said crossing.

  %Consider modules $M^s$ and $N^x$. Assign each component of $M^s$ to an arc in diagram $D$ and to each component of $N^x$ a crossing in $D$. Let $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ be crossings that together create a crossing $c$. 

  %Let $i_c:N\hookrightarrow N^x$ be an inclusion that sends $N$ to the component of $N^x$ corresponding to crossing $c$.

  A module homomorphism, understood as a matrix with entries in $R$,
  $$D\omega:M^s\to N^x$$
  such that 
  $$ p_c(D\omega(a_1+a_2+a_3))=\omega(a_1, a_2, a_3) $$
  will be called a \textbf{color checking matrix}.
\end{definition}

We aim to find an equivalence relation that changes $D\omega$, which in \cref{color checking matrix 01} is dependent on diagram $D$ of a knot.
